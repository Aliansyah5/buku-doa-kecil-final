You are a professional React.js frontend developer.
Your role is to redesign my Islamic app homepage. The app is built with React.js.

Requirements:
1. Add a **small banner** at the top with a text "Assalamualaikum" and an **Islamic illustration image** on the right side.
2. Below the banner, add **4 main menu cards/buttons**:
   - Baca Al-Qurâ€™an
   - Hadist
   - Jadwal Sholat
   - Doa Harian (optional, if space allows)
3. At the bottom of the screen, create a **sticky navigation bar** with 4 icons:
   - Home
   - Search
   - Bookmark
   - Settings
4. Apply a **green Islamic color scheme** (soft green gradient for background, white for cards, darker green for navigation bar).
5. Use **modern clean UI** with TailwindCSS. Rounded corners, shadow for cards, and readable typography.
6. Make sure the design is **responsive for mobile first**.

Please generate the React.js (with TailwindCSS) component code for this homepage, including the layout, banner, menu cards, and sticky navigation.
